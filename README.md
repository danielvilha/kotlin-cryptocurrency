# Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions.
This app brings up a list of cryptocurrencies and open their details when I click on one.

- I need to add a form to update the list.
- I need to add About this app.
- I like to save my initial list.
